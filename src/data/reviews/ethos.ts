    title: "Ethos Dunamis",
    content: "The Ethos Dunamis offers a balanced approach with its standard shape and 14mm core. Players appreciate its kevlar and carbon fiber construction, though its spin ratings are on the lower side at only 10th percentile. It's relatively lightweight with minimal swing weight, making it maneuverable but perhaps lacking in power generation. Best suited for control-oriented players who prioritize feel over raw power.",
    pros: [
      "Good balance of control and maneuverability",
      "Kevlar and carbon fiber construction offers durability",
      "Comfortable standard shape works for many playing styles"
    ],
    cons: [
      "Low spin generation (10th percentile)",
      "Minimal swing weight may limit power potential",
      "Not ideal for power-focused playing styles"
    ],
    rating: 3.7
